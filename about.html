				<h1>A Little Too Much Info About Me</h1>
				<!--<span style="font-size: 50px">&#128512;</span>-->
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="pages">
				Hi, I'm Andrew and I go to Flordia State College At Jacksonville (FSCJ),
				If I'm not studying than I'm most likely coding inside my closet until
				my parents scream at me to go out and do something.
			</div>
			<div class="pages">
				I've made a list of the best websites so you guys wouldn't have to do
				this yourselves, time is short and I wanted to help you guys get your
				dream job, or whatever it is you want to do.
			</div>
			<div class="pages">
				I've been studying programming for a little while now, before I used to
				play soccer for hours every day.I lost out on a lot of time because I
				enjoyed the sport so much that I stopped focusing on other important
				things, and it really hindered my ability. I practiced practically
				everyday for hours until my legs were hurt, or I couldn't keep going. My
				dream in life was to go pro.

			<div><h1>My 2nd Grade Journey</h1></div>
			<div class="pages">
				In second grade I was extremely good at soccer or futbol; depending on
				what you want to call it,anyways I had a great coach who had two sons,
				which were in the MLS at the time. My coach told my dad; not me, that I
				played just like them when they were younger. I always remember him
				telling me speed Aj, speed...I would run all the way down passing
				everyone and scoring.Later my dad told me all the things my coach said
				to me. I never realized this, as we moved shortly after to Connecticut.
				Before this we were living in Jacksonville, Florida. This encouraged me
				to become a better player. Eventually In highschool I wanted to really
				become a pro player,and I thought with enough hard work I could do this.
				I didn't want to play high-school though. I was better than a lot of
				people at the time(not being a egotistical maniac, just saying).Anyways
				the farther I got through High School the more depressed I got, I didn't
				tell anyone about this. It wasn't until I truly found God, and we moved
				that I found peace.(If anyone is actually reading this, than I encourage
				you to look for God, even if you don't believe in him.
			</div>
			<div class="pages">
				That's enough details about me, you'll probably end up knowing more
				about me than I do myself.

			<div><h1>Launguages I've Been learning</h1></div>
			<div class="pages">I've practiced several laungauges over the course of 2 years, and I can safely say that I still need a lot of practice, I made a lot of mistakes while teaching myself how to program. When I first started I was also playing soccer or football, whatever you want to call it. Anyways I wasn't as invested in it programming at the time, I was invested in trying to become a professional athlete, I was very good but my confidence, negativity, and all of that got the best of me and I gave up. I basically started really practicing soccer every single day, in the third grade. The older I got the more practice I gave it because of how much I wanted it. Eventually when I turned 18, I destroyed my ankle creating a giant baseball sized lump on the side of my leg. It took months to fully heal, and the doctor told me everytime I played anything that I would need to wear a brace. This was upsetting, instead of being afraid I didn't wear a brace for the most part. My ankle hurt after every practice. I didn't give up on my dream though, I kept pushing but I let people get the best of me and then I quit. Anyways what I'm trying to say is don't give up on your dream, if coding is your dream don't give up. It's very difficult and will take a lot of time, but it doesn't take a genious to code. Anywas the launguages I started learning were C++, Python, Java, and now Javascript. </div>
