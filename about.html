				Hi, I'm Andrew and I go to Flordia State College At Jacksonville (FSCJ),
				If I'm not studying than I'm most likely coding inside my closet until my parents scream at me to go out and do something.

				I've made a list of the best websites so you guys wouldn't have to do

				I've been studying programming for a little while now, before I used to
				play sports.I lost out on a lot of time because I
				enjoyed sports so much that I stopped focusing on other important
				things, and it really hindered my ability. I practiced practically
				everyday for hours until my legs were hurt, or I couldn't keep going. My
				dream in life was to go pro.

			<div class="pages">I've practiced several laungauges over the course of two years, and I can safely say that I still need a lot of practice, I made a lot of mistakes while teaching myself how to program. When I first started I was also playing soccer or football, whatever you want to call it. Anyways I wasn't as invested in it programming at the time, I was invested in trying to become a professional athlete, I was very good but my confidence, negativity, and all of that got the best of me and I gave up. I basically started really practicing soccer every single day, in the third grade. The older I got the more practice I gave it because of how much I wanted it. Eventually when I turned 18, I destroyed my ankle creating a giant baseball sized lump on the side of my leg. It took months to fully heal, and the doctor told me everytime I played anything that I would need to wear a brace. This was upsetting, instead of being afraid I didn't wear a brace for the most part. My ankle hurt after every practice. I didn't give up on my dream though, I kept pushing but I let people get the best of me and then I quit. Anyways what I'm trying to say is don't give up on your dream, if coding is your dream don't give up. It's very difficult and will take a lot of time, but it doesn't take a genius to code. Anyways the launguages I started learning were C++, Python, Java, and now Javascript. </div>
