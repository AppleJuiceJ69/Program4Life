					>
					
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>This video covers everything you need to know about Javascript, it goes into some depth on what you need to know about Javascript.It covers almost everything a beginner really needs to know. It covers equality which is extremely important, it covers scope which is also an important topic, it also covers loops, control flow, objects, variales, arrays, and even ES6 arrow functions.</div>

					>
				</div>
				<br />
				
				
				Mosh is one of my favorite teachers of all time, I learned a lot about different launguages, including: Java, C++, and now JavaScript.I highly recomend watching this video as it's only one hour long, and it covers a good amount of basic topics that could help anyone out. This video goes through a lot of important basics including: functions, arrays, and objects. His video has 7 million views on Youtube. I would highly recomend checking him out if your new to coding!!!

						><h4> #3. JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course in 8 Hours [2020]</h4>
						</a
					>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>This course is a great introduction to JavaScript, at almost 8 hours it covers a huge portion of the basics, and all the necessary concepts needed to really understand the launguage,He even has several different projects at the end which you guys can follow along. This is fantastic as building projects after learning the basics will get you more comfortable with the launguage. </div>

						><h4> #4. JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners</h4></a
					>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>Brad Traversety is a really good teacher as well. I picked up one of his courses on udemy about HTML and CSS and it went in to a lot of depth on topics, including a library called Bootstrap. However, I didn't dive deep into the course and still have yet to finish it. This youtube course dives into a lot of things beginners need to get a base understanding of Javascript. Just remember that any course you take is not going to make you an expert, even if they tell you it will. Make sure you always follow along and code along with his tutorials. Lastly, this video covers functions, objects, Arrays, and ES6 features.</div>

						><h4> #5. JavaScript Programming - Full Course</h4></a
					></div>
					<div>This video is truly amazing, it has two enormous projects, which is really important when you're just starting out. An important tip when you're learning is that It's good to follow along with the projects when your starting out. Mainly because it will help you get a sense of what you're supposed to do in order to get better at projects and build them yourselves, also it will help fix your weaknesses. This video also has main Javascript concepts needed to master this programming launguage.   </div>

				<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=9797s"><h4>#1. Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]</h4></a></div>
				<br>

				<div>Mike is an amazing teacher, I used to watch him when I was learning C++ and game development.(Which to be honest I sucked at)Anyways all of his courses are extermely well thought out, he even has a site called "Giraffe Academy", This site has front end development and many other tools. I'll link the site to the left so you can check it out. His course provides all the basics needed, he also has some great projects.One of these projects being "Mad Libs".   </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=5467s"><h4>#2. Python Tutorial - Python Full Course for Beginners</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>If you're ever going to watch a video about a programming launguage then I would highly recommend "Programming With Mosh" his tutorials are outstanding, and the depth of them is fantastic. It's an astonishing 6 hours long and covers needed material. </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/XKHEtdqhLK8" target="blank"><h4>#3. Python Full Course üêç„ÄêùôÅùôßùôöùôö„Äë</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>Bro Code has some fantastic tutorials as well. He isn't as popular as the rest on this list, but a lot of his videos still get  millions of views. This video is very beginner friendly, and has a whopping 50 million views. Bro code usually goes in depth on his videos, working on things that you would probably not see in other video tutorials. The knowledge you get off of his videos is unlike most videos.  </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=3546s" target="blank"><h4>#4. Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>If you don't fancy sitting around for 6 hours and trying to get the basics of Python, then I would recommend this Video, which is just a shortened version of his Mosh's 6 hour course. If you are just starting out with Python then I would recommend this course, eventually taking longer courses and going through more advanced concepts. </div>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><h1>Top 5 Java Youtube Videos</h1></div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34"target="blank"><h4>#1. Java Tutorial for Beginners</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This video by Mosh is only 2.5 hours long, which is a perfect length. It isn't too long and it isn't too short. I would recommend this one over any Java Course on Youtube because Mosh simplifies everything so well, he makes learning fun, and he takes complicated things and makes them easier. Most videos fail to do that. Also, his videos are incredibly well put together. </div>
				<div>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/xk4_1vDrzzo"target="blank"><h4>#2. Java Full Course ‚òï„ÄêùôÅùôßùôöùôö„Äë</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>I actually watched this whole video before I decided to switch and start  learning "Web Development". I just wasn't that into Java as much as I thought I was. Try not to do what I did, don't change launguages until you master all the concepts of one first.If you know the basics of one launguage, and understand programming a bit better, then learning another launguage will be easier for you.If you don't then it may take longer as your not actually good enough to really understand another launguage. Anyways this course is fantastic, and will be a good watch if your serious about Java. </div>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/GoXwIVyNvX0"target="blank"></a><h4>#3. Intro to Java Programming - Course for Absolute Beginners</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>FreeCodeCamp has always been good to me, their courses are just fantastic, the best part is they're free and have thousands of free tutorials online, all rated extremely high. This 3.5 hour course from "FreeCodeCamp" goes through the basics in great details, but it doesn't provide any projects though. If you're looking for projects to help solidify your knowledge, then this may not be the video for you. </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/8cm1x4bC610"target="blank"><h4>#4. Java Tutorial for Beginners | Full Course</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>I've only watched a little bit of Tesusko's tutorials, so I don't have too much information about this video. However, It does seem to show the basics in great depth, and most of his videos are highly rated. He doesn't have any project sections in this video 'though'. </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/hBh_CC5y8-s"><h4>#5. Java Full Course | Java Tutorial for Beginners | Java Online Training | Edureka</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This video is extremely long, just like "Bro Code's" video is. In my opinion I prefer Bro Code, as I'm more familiar with his channel, and enjoy his teaching style a lot more. Although, It goes from basics to a little bit harder concepts solidifying your knowledge. This is a good thing as you'll always be advancing, but if you're just starting out, I would focus on main essential basics first.</div>

				<div><h1>Top 5 C++ Youtube Videos</h1></div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/vLnPwxZdW4Y"target="blank"><h4>#1. C++ Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This was one of the first videos I watched when I began my coding journey, Mike Dane is fantastic, and this is why I put this at the top. His course goes through functions, variables, and small projects.He goes through projects in between learning a new concept. This is very useful as it helps develop new concepts easier.</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o" target="blank"><h4>#2. C++ Programming Course - Beginner to Advanced</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This gigantic course takes your skill from a beginner all the way up to advanced. Advanced is a bit of a overstatement, but it will help you get confident enough to code on your own. This course has an easy to read setup, showing each section in the description, so you can look for all the concepts. This is also beneficial because it will save you time. This course is about a day long, so it should teach you most of the needed syntax and concepts. </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/GQp1zzTwrIg" target="blank"><h4>#3. C++ FULL COURSE For Beginners (Learn C++ in 10 hours)</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This course is 10 hours long which is also very long, but not quite as long as the other course. I feel that this course is very good, but not quite in par with the other C++ videos out there. Mainly because they provide more hours and have a little more experience. However, this course provides you with the needed tools to get going on your dream journey of one of the hardest programming launguages. She provided all the course details in the description, and even on the video it shows every coding lesson.I find this awesome as it saves me time, and it should hopefully save you time as well.  </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/_bYFu9mBnr4" target="blank"><h4>#4. C++ Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (10 HOURS!)</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This is another 10 hour video about C++ programming, and it's also very popular. This course is great, but I feel like it is subpar with the other courses. It's just that the other courses give you more value for your time. Although this course isn't as good it still provides needed information for beginner programmers. </div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/uhFpPlMsLzY" target="blank"><h4>#5. C++ Crash Course üë®‚Äçüíª„ÄêùôÅùôßùôöùôö„Äë</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>Bro Code has some unique things that he adds to his videos that other channels don't implement.I put him in last even though his video is short, and implements the basics. It's just not as top tier as the rest, but if your very new to programming than you could watch his video before you watch a longer and better video. The reason being is you'll get a basis of the launguage. This video is still extremely well put together.</div>

					<div><h1>Top 5 C# Youtube Videos</h1></div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/GhQdlIFylQ8"target="blank"><h4>#1. C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>Again FreeCodeCamp comes on top for their fantastic youtube videos. C# is a basic launguage that isn't as popular anymore, but is great for Game Development. This is one of the best courses that I could find about it on Youtube. It has timelined content in the description and in the video which will be a timesaver. Their isn't too much high quality videos on c#, but Mike Dane really delivered on this one. .Overall I would highly recommend this course to anyone learning C#.</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/gfkTfcpWqAY"target="blank"><h4>#2. C# Tutorial For Beginners - Learn C# Basics in 1 Hour</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This course is only one hour long and can teach you a great deal of basics in a slow teachable manner which you'll most likely enjoy. In every video Mosh provides you with an insane amount of detail in a way that will make you feel like you can do anything. Mosh makes even the hardest things seem easy. In this video it's no different from the rest. At one hour long you'll get some of the basics of C#. Tip: I would recommend watching this before going on to a longer video, as it will give you a basic understand of C# in only one hour. Also Mosh usually takes the rest of this course and makes you pay for it. He does this a lot, but his paid courses are great too.</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/wxznTygnRfQ"target="blank"><h4>#3. C# Full Course üéÆ„ÄêùôÅùôßùôöùôö„Äë</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>In this course Bro Code provides you with a great base to get started using the launguage. Most of this tutorial is for people who want to get into game development using Unity. Basically you get to learn the basics of programming, experience cool projects which will help you get a grasp of the launguage, and cool concepts which will help you later on. He has all the concepts located in the description for ease of use, and has all the concepts in order on the video.</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href="https://youtu.be/qOruiBrXlAw"target="blank"><h4>#4. C# Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (6 HOURS!)</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This course isn't as highly rated as the others, but it does have all the concepts ordered in the description and even in the video. His concepts at first are a little bit different than the other videos as it focuses a little bit of attention on app making. This is alright though as it may be something that will please you immediately or may be a turn off. This course is 6 hours long and most of it features similar things to other courses.</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<div><a href=""target="blank"><h4>#5. C# Complete Tutorial From Beginner To Advance - By Bob Tabor - FL Developers</h4></a></div>
				<br>
				<div>This course is great, but it doesn't have any content inside the description and the video doesn't show the timestamps for the concepts, making it hard to see what the video is going to focus on. If this bugs you than I would recommend a different course. This is the main reason why this course is all the way in 5th place. It doesn't mean it's necessarily bad, but with the other courses in mind, it isn't as good.</div>
